        "2. **Performance and Efficiency**: Bigrams offer a balance between performance and computational resources. While trigrams and higher-order n-grams can provide more detailed context, they come at the cost of increased computational complexity and potentially diminishing returns in terms of accuracy improvements.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Contextual Relevance**: For many applications, the context provided by bigrams is sufficient to make accurate predictions or corrections. Higher-order n-grams may capture more nuanced contexts, but this additional detail is often unnecessary for the task of spelling correction.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Simplicity and Maintainability**: Bigrams simplify the model, making it easier to understand, implement, and maintain. This simplicity is particularly valuable in applications where the model's complexity needs to be kept to a minimum.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the decision to use bigrams instead of trigrams or higher-order n-grams is based on a combination of factors, including the sufficiency of bigrams for the task, the trade-off between performance and computational efficiency, the relevance of the context captured by bigrams, and the benefits of simplicity and maintainability.\n",
